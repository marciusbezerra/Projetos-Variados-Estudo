                  IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Before using your dBASE III PLUS Disks, please note the 
following information before installing dBASE III PLUS:

For 256K dBASE III PLUS Operation:

dBASE III PLUS runs with DOS version 2.xx if you have 256K
installed memory in your computer.  If you have a mimimum 
of 384K of installed memory, dBASE III PLUS runs with DOS version
3.xx as well as version 2.xx. 

For 256K operation, we provide two files, CONFI256.SYS and
CONFI256.DB, on System Disk #1.  These two files set system
parameters for maximum overall performance of dBASE III PLUS in a
256K environment.  Save the original CONFIG.SYS and CONFIG.DB
files (also on System Disk #1) to another disk, and then use the
DOS COPY command to copy CONFI256.SYS and CONFI256.DB to
CONFIG.SYS and CONFIG.DB respectively.
